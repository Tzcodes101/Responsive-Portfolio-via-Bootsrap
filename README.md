# Responsive-Portfolio-via-Bootsrap
* This website uses the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a responsive portfolio, including a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images.

* I used bootstrap as a framework to create a desired layout for each page, then minimized extra classes, and edited my semantic layout by using html Flow Doctor and an html validation service.

I am unsure why my portfolio images and background CSS are not appearing. I tried changing my background image to a color, but left the CSS in a commented form for the background image. I think it could be related to how to site is not fully live yet.
